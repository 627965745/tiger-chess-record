This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

My favorite streamer, tiger, plays a traditional chinese chess game, Four-Nation-Chess(not an offical name) on Douyin.

The game interface is like this:

## Basic Idea of the Game
In this game, players assume the roles of four different nations, each with its unique strengths and weaknesses. The objective is to outmaneuver opponents and ultimately capture their capital city. However, the game goes beyond mere tactical moves; it delves into the realm of psychology and judgment.

To succeed in Four Nations Chess, players must carefully analyze the board, anticipate their opponents' moves, and make strategic decisions based on the available information. The game rewards those who can think several steps ahead, assess risks, and employ effective mind games.

Psychological warfare plays a crucial role in Four Nations Chess. By bluffing, misdirecting, or misleading opponents, players can gain a significant advantage. The ability to read your opponent's intentions, decipher their tactics, and manipulate their decision-making is essential. It requires a deep understanding of human psychology and the skill to leverage that knowledge to your advantage.

Moreover, judgment plays a vital role in Four Nations Chess. Players must weigh the risks and rewards of each move, considering both immediate consequences and long-term implications. A well-timed sacrifice or a calculated defensive maneuver can completely alter the course of the game. Players must constantly evaluate the evolving situation, adapt their strategies, and make difficult judgment calls to stay one step ahead.

## Story for making this App
In this game, Tiger, the streamer, who is highly skilled player, possess the ability to accurately estimate the positions of their opponents' pieces. He enjoys engaging with his audience and often involve them in the gameplay.

When he deduces the size of an opponent's piece based on its movement, he marks it on the board. This allows viewers in the live chat to challenge the streamer's judgment. If someone doubts the streamer's assessment, they can type their disagreement in the chat. The chat administrators keep a record of the names of those who challenge the streamer. After the game ends, the results are tallied, and rewards are given to the winners.


At the beginning, there were only a few participants in the game, making it relatively easy to keep track of the records. However, as the game gained popularity, more and more people started playing. The original method of typing on the keyboard to record the gameplay became time-consuming and laborious. It required manually calculating each player's matches and keeping track of wins and losses.

Realizing the growing interest in supporting the streamer's game, I volunteered to develop a web application to assist with recording and statistics. This program significantly reduces the time and effort needed for record-keeping and tracking.

The web application I developed serves as a convenient tool for administrators to input plays, outcomes, and overall game progress. It automates the process of tracking individual gameplay sessions and calculating wins and losses. With this program in place, administrators no longer need to manually record and tally results, saving them valuable time and energy.

The introduction of the web application not only enhances the efficiency of recording and statistics but also contributes to the overall enjoyment of the game. Participants can focus more on the strategic aspects of Four Nations Chess, as the burden of manual record-keeping is alleviated. This development fosters a smoother and more engaging experience for both the streamer and the players, allowing them to fully immerse themselves in the game without distractions.
